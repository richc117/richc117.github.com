Hi! this is my portfolio that I built with the use of Twitter-Bootstrap. I just graduated from UCSD with a BS in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Human Cognition and Human Computer Interaction. My time at UCSD was awesome, I loved learning about human behavior and how we interact with the environment around us. Unless we are in a remote untouched part of the world, we are surrounded by a man-made environment. We traverse and interact with this environment everyday. Sometimes our environment can be frustrating and confusing but there times often rarely noticed when we appreciate the careful thought, care, and consideration someone took to make that environment pleasant and efficient. Our environment is not limited to the physical world around us. Digital space has opened an entirely new environment for us and we are increasingly spending more of our time in this space. I want to design the way we interact with this space in a way that is complementary to our behavior, emotions, and cognition.
